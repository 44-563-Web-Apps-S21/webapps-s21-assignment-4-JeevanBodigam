        This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
        Gaoler, look to him.</p>

    <p class="speech">I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
        I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
        Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
        But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
        The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
        Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
        To come abroad with him at his request.</p>
