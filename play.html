    <h1>Jeevan Bodigam Presents</h1>
    <h2>The Merchant of Venice</h2>
    <h5>Act 3,SCENE III. Venice. A street.</h5>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler</p>
    <h6 class="name shylock">SHYLOCK</h6>
    <p class="speech">Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
        This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
        Gaoler, look to him.</p>
    <h6 class="name antonio">ANTONIO
    </h6>
    <p class="speech">Hear me yet, good Shylock.</p>
    <h6 class="name shylock">SHYLOCK</h6>
    <p class="speech">I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
        I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
        Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
        But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
        The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
        Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
        To come abroad with him at his request.</p>
    <h6 class="name antonio">ANTONIO</h6>
    <p class="speech">I pray thee, hear me speak.</p>
    <h6 class="name shylock">SHYLOCK</h6>
    <p class="speech">I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
        I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
        I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
        To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
        To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
        I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">Exit</p>

    <h6 class="name salarino">SALARINO</h6>
    <p class="speech">It is the most impenetrable cur
        That ever kept with men.</p>
    <h6 class="name antonio">ANTONIO</h6>
    <p class="speech">Let him alone:
        I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
        He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
        I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
        Many that have at times made moan to me;
        Therefore he hates me.</p>
    <h6 class="name salarino">SALARINO</h6>
    <p class="speech">I am sure the duke
        Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.</p>
    <h6 class="name antonio">ANTONIO</h6>
    <p class="speech">The duke cannot deny the course of law:
        For the commodity that strangers have
        With us in Venice, if it be denied,
        Will much impeach the justice of his state;
        Since that the trade and profit of the city
        Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
        These griefs and losses have so bated me,
        That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
        To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
        Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
        To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">Exeunt</p>
